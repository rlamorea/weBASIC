# Welcome to weBASIC

_A BASIC that runs in the browser that is both retro and modern_

## Why weBASIC?

weBASIC has been created to provide an introductory programming language to host on a modern computer.

If you really want to learn more, read about the language and the ideas behind it [here](about).

## Where to Start?

There are two forms of weBASIC:

 - Embedded: a form of weBASIC with limited file storage support able to be run directly in the browser.
 - Local: a form of weBASIC that runs local to your computer and has access to your local file system.

The fastest way to get started is to run the embedded version.

Simply [GO HERE](todo)

You will start out in the *LIVE* mode:

<pre>
weBASIC v0.5

READY.
<cursor>_</cursor>
</pre>

A cursor (blinking underline) shows it is waiting for you to type a command.

At this point, you can choose where to go next:

 - [Getting Started with weBASIC](getting-started)
 - [Your First weBASIC Program](first-program)
 - [Learn the weBASIC Language](language)
 - [weBASIC reference](reference/)

## Troubleshooting

As issues arise with weBASIC, look here for information as how to work around them (until, hopefully, they
are addressed in a subsequent update).

- [Mac and the Keyboard](#mac-and-the-keyboard)

### Mac and the Keyboard

By default the CTRL left/right arrow key sequences are mapped
to Mission Control. As a result, they never get to the browser.
It is also possible that META left/right won't make it to the
browser either.

Keyboard controls for moving the cursor have been set up to
work around this for now. But if you still are encountering
problems, you may need to search through keyboard settings
on the Mac and in your applications to find and disable/remap
sequences that prevent the proper use of weBASIC inputs and
editing.
