# Your First Program

The point of weBASIC is to let you tell your computer to do something.

You may already have tried out [doing this directly](getting-started.md), but if you want to 
do anything truly interesting, you'll need to write a _program_.

A **PROGRAM** is a set of instructions for the computer to execute in some specific order.

Let's get started!

- [**Taking a Hard Line** - understanding line numbers](#taking-a-hard-line)
- [**Say Hello** - running your first program](#say-hello)
- [**Save Yourself** - saving your program for later](#save-yourself)
- [**Bring That Back** - deleting and then (re)loading your program](#bring-that-back)
- [**Variable Nature** - using variables](#variable-nature)
- [**Critical Condition** - conditional execution](#critical-condition)
- [**Thrown for a Loop** - looping execution](#thrown-for-a-loop)
- [Where To Next?](#where-to-next)

## Taking a Hard Line

(line numbers, goto)

## Say Hello

(execution)

## Save Yourself

(saving programs)

## Bring That Back!

(new and load)

## Variable Nature

(variables)

### Know Your Numbers

numbers vs integers

### Stringing ALong

strings

## Critical Condition

(if/then)

### True or False?

0 vs 1, conditional operators

### It's Very Logical

logical operators

### Just Go

THEN <line>

### Know Your Limits

THEN applies to the end of the line.]

## Thrown for a Loop

(for/to/next)

### Watch Your Step

(step)

## Where To Next?
