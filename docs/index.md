### Mac and the Keyboard

By default the CTRL left/right arrow key sequences are mapped
to Mission Control. As a result, they never get to the browser.

Since CTRL left/right are how you get to the start/end of the
current input line, you will need to disable the Mission Control
mappings in order for this functionality to work.
