### Mac and the Keyboard

By default the CTRL left/right arrow key sequences are mapped
to Mission Control. As a result, they never get to the browser.
It is also possible that META left/right won't make it to the
browser either.

Keyboard controls for moving the cursor have been set up to
work around this for now. But if you still are encountering
problems, you may need to search through keyboard settings
on the Mac and in your applications to find and disable/remap
sequences that prevent the proper use of weBASIC inputs and
editing.
