# Learning the Language

At its core, weBASIC is just BASIC. Although there really isn't a standard for the BASIC programming
language, there is a set of commands and syntax that are common across every implementation of it.

Let's explore these.

- [**What You Should Know By Now** - just checking](#what-you-should-know-by-now)
- [**Variable Nature** - all about using variables](#variable-nature)
- [**Function Junction** - important functions](#function-junction)
- [**Critical Condition** - conditional execution](#critical-condition)
- [**Thrown for a Loop** - looping execution](#thrown-for-a-loop)
- [**Do You Have Any Comment?** - adding comments to your code](#do-you-have-any-comment) 
- [**Reading Comprehension** - reading in data](#reading-comprehension)
- [**Routine Maintenance** - subroutines and reusable code](#routine-maintenance)
- [**Where to Next?** - more to explore](#where-to-next)

## What You Should Know By Now

(print, operators, functions, line numbers, goto, save, new, load, variables, input)

## Variable Nature

(variables)

### Know Your Numbers

numbers vs integers

### Stringing Along

strings

### A Vast Array

arrays

## Critical Condition

(if/then)

### True or False?

0 vs 1, conditional operators

### It's Very Logical

logical operators

### Just Go

THEN <line>

### Know Your Limits

THEN applies to the end of the line.]

## Thrown for a Loop

### You've Seen This Before

(building loops with GOTO and )

### Who's Next?

(for/to/next)

### Watch Your Step

(step)

## Do You Have Any Comment?

(comments, rem and back-tick)

## Reading Comprehension

(read and data)

### Needs Restoration

(restore)

### Literal Data

(discussion of data strings without quotes)

## Routine Maintenance

(subroutine theory)

### Out and Back

gosub and return

### Reported Side Effects

messing with variables inside/outside subroutines
